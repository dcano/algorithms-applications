<br>
Based on algorithms implementation by Bob Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne provided as part of Coursera Algorithms course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome)
<br><br>
<b>Considerations:<b>
<ul>
<li>Please note that library containing algorithms implementation is not included, enroll the course to obtain it.</li>
<li>Please, if you are doing the course, do not use this code otherwise you will be breaking the Coursera Honor Code.</li>
